title:  "HW20: Team Progress II"
---
I feel like our team made great progress on the most recent deliverable (deliverable 4)! We met via Zoom more often than we did between any other two variables. That made a tremendous difference in our efficiency as we were able to "pair code" like we may have in-person had this been any other semester. 

We also had a sad yet real-world software engineering experience this time around that I wanted to share. We met one day to update the output given your (Dr. Bowring's) feedback to make it more verbose in the previous deliverable. This ended up being a lot more complicated than we imagined going into it. We chose to use a package called HTMLTestRunner because it integrated with the other package we were using with the test cases (unittest). Our output in deliverable 3 was based on the default template from this package. In order to make it more verbose, we had to jump into the template engine it uses - Jinja2. None of had ever worked with this, so it became a very time-consuming (yet interesting) task. We were thrilled once we got the output printing like we wanted by creating new html columns and looping through test case parameters. However, when we got together the next day to complete the rest of deliverable 4, it was gone! As you can imagine, this taught us some valuable lessons about version control/Git. Luckily, we were able to scrape our template back together in a fraction of the time based on what we learned in the previous session.

Looking forward to deliverable 5, we are thinking about how we can inject faults into our code. We are also working on improving our documentation and compiling everything into one super neat, professional report. It will be crucial to stay organized with all of the major components of the project coming up (report, presentation, poster).

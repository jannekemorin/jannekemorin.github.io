Hi everyone! My name is Janneke (pronounced ‘Yah-Nuh-Kuh’) Morin. 

I grew up Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Since school went online in Spring 2020, I have been staying with my family in Killington, Vermont. This semester, I will be moving back to Charleston. I’m a junior at the College this year pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I plan to graduate in Fall 2021.

When I started college as a Business major, Computer Science wasn’t on my radar, but I changed course after taking (and loving) CSCI 220 my first semester. I found a passion for Computer Science and am interested in Software Engineering as a career. I had some exposure to Software Engineering in CSCI 362, of course, and I'm looking forward to the open-source aspect of this course.

Currently, I work as a Technical Operations Specialist at Ceterus, an accounting software company based in Charleston. I have loved working in TechOps, but I'm not sure whether the best career for me is more rooted in TechOps or Software Engineering. I enjoy working on processes in TechOps, but I feel that Software Engineering provides better career opportunities. I'm hoping that my classes in the next couple of semesters will help me narrow down my interests.

Although I enjoy spending time behind the computer, some of my other hobbies include running, hiking, and going outdoors with friends in general. I’m also a huge animal lover and have four lab-mixes here at home.



Looking forward to getting to know you,


Janneke

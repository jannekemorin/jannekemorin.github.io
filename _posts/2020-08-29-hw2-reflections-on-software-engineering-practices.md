#### The Complexity of Software and Its Evolution
Software is, by definition, complex. Frederick P. Brooks, in his article "Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering," describes the essence of a software entity as "a construct of interlocking concepts: data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms, and invocations of functions." 

This week's readings reminded me of the sheer amount of moving pieces that drive software and how this complexity connects to its other characteristics. For instance, a constant need to change. Each "interlocking concept" evolves in its own right; the software has to keep up to keep from breaking. This comes with complications because when a change is made, all of the dependencies have to be considered. For instance, take something as simple as a developer reconfiguring a database, renaming columns and changing their order; any file referencing that database may need to be reworked. I witnessed this scenario at my job in technical operations and found it incredible how much planning went into adding a few new columns to a data source that populates the user interface! Given the complexity of changing software, it becomes dangerous to merge personal changes against code that's not up-to-date. In his article, "Cherry-Picking and the Scientific Method," George V. Neville-Neil, writes that “the real work” is periodically merging whatever code we are working against. If we keep the tip of the git, as he calls it, from straying too far without our work, we can prevent a lot of unnecessary trouble reworking it to accommodate the latest version.


#### Lessons from Google: Productivity, Reliability, and Simplicity
Given how quickly complex software can become a "monster" - in Brooks' words - with bad practices, it's no surprise what a great emphasis is put on healthy software practices. I first read the three words productivity, reliability, and simplicity mentioned together in "Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering." The author suggests that the antitheses of these create software costs, thereby suggesting that we should strive for productivity, reliability, and simplicity in our work as software engineers. 

While reading about Google's codebase systems in the article "Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository" by Rachel Potvin and Josh Levenberg, I kept these attributes on my mind. What better company to analyze for lessons on successful software practices?

The first characteristic I noticed in Google's systems was **simplicity**. According to the article, Google stores one billion files, a history of approximately 35 million commits, and 86TBs of data in a monolithic repository. I was shocked by this! The single repository is by no means small, which prevents its own challenges, but its monolithic nature allows for simpler tooling with just one system of reference. I think that this is one of the biggest takeaways going into our team project - if Google can keep things simple, we certainly can - and it'll probably help us in the long run.

Google also implements a number of systems to support code **reliability**. Particularly, they've implemented sophisticated automated testing which covers each dependency impacted by the change at hand. They have also automated the reversal of the unlikely changes that do cause breakage. As Neville-Neil writes in "Cherry-Picking...," "no part of working on software should be based on gut feelings, because, after all, software is supposed to be a part of computer science, and science demands proof." Google's automated testing work to "prove" the safety of each change, maintaining the reliability of a codebase worked on by thousands of developers on a daily basis.

The third and final attribute, **productivity**, is primarily supported by Piper and CitC architectures. These tools allow the developers to work on such a large database as the Google repository through their own synced local "workspace." By only storing modified files, workspaces consume a relatively small amount of storage while giving developers quick access to anything they need from the distributed cloud repository. Through the trunk-based development model, engineers work from the most recent version of the code, making changes through "single, serial ordering."

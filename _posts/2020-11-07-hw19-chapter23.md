#### 23.6 Figure 23.14 shows the task durations for software project activities. Assume that a serious, unanticipated setback occurs, and instead of taking 10 days, task T5 takes 40 days. Draw up new bar charts showing how the project might be reorganized.

This was a really interesting exercise. I used ![this article](https://www.teamgantt.com/free-gantt-chart-excel-template) to create a gantt bar chart. T5, the task we are extending, is only a dependency for one task. This task (T10) has another dependency (T9) that finishes at a later date. Hence, I don't think that this change actually impacts the timeline of the project much, if at all.

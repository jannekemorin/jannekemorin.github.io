#### 4.5: Using the technique suggested here, where natural language descriptions are presented in a standard format, write plausible user requirements for the following functions:
#### An unattended petrol (gas) pump system that includes a credit card reader. The customer swipes the card through the reader, then specifies the amount of fuel required. The fuel is delivered and customer's account debited.
1. The petrol pump system shall charge the customer's account the correct amount of money based on the amount of fuel specified.
2. The petrol pump system shall provide secure credit card processing.
3. The petrol pump system shall provide the customer with a record of their transaction (through a receipt).
4. The petrol pump system shall implement mechanisms to ensure safe fuel delivery.
5. The petrol pump system shall deliver the smaller of the amount of fuel specified and the amount of fuel to fill the tank.

#### The cash-dispensing function in a bank ATM.
1. The cash-dispensing function shall keep track of the amount of cash available.
2. The cash-dispensing function shall ensure the ATM stays stocked with cash by notifying the administrator when cash is low.
3. The cash-dispensing function shall keep bills neat and organized for quick delivery.
4. The cash-dispensing function shall integrate with existing bank software to verify the user's accounts.
5. The cash-dispensing function shall detect and report suspected fraudulent activity.

#### In an Internet banking system, a facility that allows customers to transfer funds from one account held with the bank to another account with the same bank.
1. The Internet banking system shall prevent transfers that would result in negative account balances.
2. The Internet banking system shall limit the number of transfers allowed per customer per month.
3. The Internet banking system shall allow customers to schedule transfers.
4. The Internet banking system shall allow customers to set up recurring transfers.
5. The Internet banking system shall allow customers to document their transfers through notes.


#### 4.6 Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.


#### 4.7 Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.

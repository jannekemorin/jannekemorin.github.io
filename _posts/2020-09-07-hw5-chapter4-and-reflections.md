#### 4.5: Using the technique suggested here, where natural language descriptions are presented in a standard format, write plausible user requirements for the following functions:
#### An unattended petrol (gas) pump system that includes a credit card reader. The customer swipes the card through the reader, then specifies the amount of fuel required. The fuel is delivered and customer's account debited.
#### The cash-dispensing function in a bank ATM.
#### In an Internet banking system, a facility that allows customers to transfer funds from one account held with the bank to another account with the same bank.


#### 4.6 Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.


#### 4.7 Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.
